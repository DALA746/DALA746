Hello World! 🙋‍♀️, I’m Darya, a creative front-end developer with an event coordinating background. 

👋🏽 Hi, I'm Darya, a creative frontend developer with event coordinating background.

🎓 Currently studying at Technigo Coding bootcamp - Fall 2021

🌇 Live in Stockholm, with a passion for creating user-friendly and useful projects that will solve people's problems.

📚  I have 7 years of experience in organizing events and conferences. During this time I have developed my problem-solving skills and learned a lot about communication and time management. Now, I am a front-end developer who loves to crack coding problems and create user-friendly projects.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as frontend developer and work with a supportive team where we create user-friendly projects to solve people's problems.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me working out or taking a walk, playing video games and reading books.

💪🏽 My favorite stack includes: HTML, CSS, React, React Redux, Styled Components, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
