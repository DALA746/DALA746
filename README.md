👋 Hi, I'm Darya, a creative frontend developer with event coordinating background.

🎓 Graduated at Technigo Coding bootcamp - Winter 2022

🌇 Live in Stockholm, with a passion for creating user-friendly projects and solving coding problems.

📚 I have seven years of experience in event coordinating. During this time, I have been working in a high-path environment with a big team, daily solved customer's problems, organized schedules and developed my communications skills. I am looking forward to implement those skills in my new job as a developer and contribute to the company and to the team.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as a front-end developer with supportive team where we create user-friendly projects and where I learn new technologies at the same time.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me hanging out with friends and family, working out, playing video games or reading books.

💪🏽 My favorite stack includes: React, React Redux, React Router, Styled Components, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
